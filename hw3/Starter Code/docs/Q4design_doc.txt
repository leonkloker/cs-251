# TODO: Write a short (1-3 paragraph) design document about your solution to Q4.
#       Please include the following:
#     
#         1) An explanation of what you wrote and how the ScriptPubKey works
#         2) Briefly, how the ScriptPubKey you wrote fits into the bigger 
#            picture of this atomic swap.
#         3) Consider the case of Alice sending coins to Bob with coinExchangeScript:
#            Why can Alice always get her money back if Bob doesn't redeem it? 
#            Why can't this be solved with a simple 1-of-2 multisig? 
#

1) The ScriptPubkey has two different ways it can be redeemed which are differentiated by an OP_IF
OP_ELSE clause, hence, the way to redeem the UTXO can be determined by including either OP_FALSE 
or OP_TRUE in the ScriptSig. The first way is used when the swap goes smoothly: B provides the secret x
and his signature and the UTXO can be redeemed. The second way is used in case one of the parties suddenly
doesn't stick to the protocol. The participant who created the UTXO has the signature of the other
participant on the spending UTXO that just refunds the coins (as part of the protocol), by signing
this spending UTXO himself, the signatures of both participants are provided and the UTXO which was 
supposed to be used for the swap can just be returned to the original owner.

2) The ScriptPubkey essentially locks the coins to be swapped for a fixed period of time
within which either the swap is conducted as intended (as both parties signed the other party's 
refund UTXO, posted their swap UTXO on chain, the party with knowledge of the key redeemed the 
other party's swap UTXO revealing the secret and allowing the other party to also redeem the swap
UTXO) or one of the parties turned out to be unfaithful. In this case, after the time has 
passed, the original owner can simply get a refund of the fixed amount, as the signature of 
the refund UTXO by the other party was provided before the swap UTXO was posted on chain.

3) If Bob doesn't redeem the script within the fixed time period, Alice can just sign 
the redeem UTXO which has been already signed by Bob before Alice's swap UTXO was posted 
on chain. As she has both signatures now, she can redeem her swap UTXO. 

If the swap UTXO of Alice would just contain a 1-out-of-2 multisig, Alice could just 
redeem the UTXO the moment she redeemed Bob's swap UTXO (or the other way around),
thus ending up with both coins.
